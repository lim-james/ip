# Dwight Companion

> _“Whenever I’m about to do something, I think, ‘Would an idiot do that?’ And if they would, I do not do that.” – Dwight Schrute_

The _Dwight Companion_ is the ultimate assistant for productivity and beet-based efficiency. It will not only help you manage your tasks, but also prove once and for all that computers can never outsell the best paper salesman.

* text-based like Schrute Farms invoices
* easy to learn _(even Kevin could use it)_
* FAST - To give you a reference point, it is somewhere between a snake and a mongoose… and a panther.
